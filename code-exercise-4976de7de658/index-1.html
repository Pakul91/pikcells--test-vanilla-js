<h1 id="image-interview-code-test">Image Interview Code Test</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>A Pikcells code test for job applicants to demonstrate their ability to construct a dynamic client side interface built using Javascript. Any code snippets used should reference original source in comments. Original code is absolutely preferred.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in the way you handle, load, manage and filter data. UI design is <em>not</em> a priority.</p>
<p>You can use any flavour of JS you wish and at a <em>minimum</em> it must run in the browser it was developed with. Any possible compatibility issues should be noted in the comments, full cross browser testing is <em>not</em> a requirement.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-it-do">What should it do?</h2>
<p>We want the site visitor to flex their design and creativity skills and create a good looking kitchen. It's most definitely not that our stylists are too busy and we're trying to offload the work onto the user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the configuration file and present/build a clickable menu to change the layers. The menu should use the names from the json file</li>
<li>The items in the menu should be ordered according to the "order" value in the items array</li>
<li>It should initialise showing a pre-determined default configuration which is in the json file</li>
<li>The user should be able to save their configured image to their computer somehow and the client doesn't want to pay for another server to merge the images :(</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-should-it-do-it">How should it do it?</h2>
<p>Everything should run locally in the users browser, images and configuration data should be loaded from the URLs listed below.</p>
<p>The configuration data is available as a json file served from https://lab.pikcells.com/code-exercise/data.json .</p>
<p>Please prefix all image requests with https://lab.pikcells.com/code-exercise/images/</p>
<p>Sadly our database administrator didn't order the items in the json results, that's going to need sorting client side. Darn DB administrators right?</p>
<p>An example JSON output is:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>{
    "layers": [
        {
            "order": 0,
            "items": [
                {
                    "order": 1,
                    "name": "Almost Silly Silver",
                    "imgSrc": "BWK.jpg"
                },
                {
                    "order": 0,
                    "name": "Typically Pretty Blue",
                    "imgSrc": "hk9.jpg"
                },
                {
                    "order": 2,
                    "name": "Terribly Honest Black",
                    "imgSrc": "aDn.jpg"
                }
            ]
        },{
            "order": 1,
            "items": [
                {
                    "order": 0,
                    "name": "Really Eloquent Blue",
                    "imgSrc": "0Og.png"
                },
                {
                    "order": 1,
                    "name": "Extremely Honest Silver",
                    "imgSrc": "2Ks.png"
                },
                {
                    "order": 2,
                    "name": "Terribly Confident Pink",
                    "imgSrc": "L99.png"
                }
            ]
        },{
            "order": 2,
            "items": [
                {
                    "order": 2,
                    "name": "Too Melodic Silver",
                    "imgSrc": "jeb.png"
                },
                {
                    "order": 0,
                    "name": "Never Generous Silver",
                    "imgSrc": "VRC.png"
                },
                {
                    "order": 1,
                    "name": "Terribly Juicy Green",
                    "imgSrc": "58Z.png"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "default_configuration": [
        2,
        1,
        0
    ]
}</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>This should render a menu like below.</p>
<p>```</p>
<h2 id="layer-0-layers">Layer 0  &lt;-- layers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Almost Silly Silver &lt;--- items</li>
<li>Typically Pretty Blue</li>
<li>Terribly Honest Black <em>selected</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="layer-1">Layer 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Really Eloquent Blue</li>
<li>Extremely Honest Silver <em>selected</em></li>
<li>Terribly Confident Pink</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="layer-2">Layer 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Too Melodic Silver <em>selected</em></li>
<li>Never Generous Silver</li>
<li>Terribly Juicy Green</li>
</ul>
<p>```</p>
<p>Only one image/item per layer should be selectable and a visual cue should highlight the currently selected item. The images are transparent and should be layered up by some means. The order of layering can be determined by the "layers" -&gt; "order" property.</p>
<h2 id="special-notes">Special Notes</h2>
<p>The json file will randomise the number of options, names and order on every fetch.</p>
<p>Both the images and JSON file have CORS access control headers set to all (*) origins.</p>
<p>The folders /exercise-src/data and /exercise-src/images are included <em>only</em> for reference purposes, your code should load the images and json file from our lab.pikcells.com server.</p>
<h2 id="code-submission">Code submission</h2>
<p>Please either
- compress your work into a single file and send a download link (Google Drive, dropbox, wetransfer etc) to pete@pikcells.com
- send us a link to a repository of your choosing.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-of-code">Ownership of code</h2>
<p>You will always retain the ownership of code written for this test.</p>
